Upgrading from r151006 to r151008
=================================

NOTE - THIS PAGE IS OBSOLETE AS r151008 IS OBSOLETE
---------------------------------------------------

Please upgrade to at least r151014, per \[wiki:Upgrade\_to\_r151014
here\]

END OF NOTE
-----------

**Important:** You must be running r151006 in order to upgrade to
r151008. Upgrading from previous releases is not supported.

Pre-Upgrade Preparation
-----------------------

Starting with r151008, packages shipped by OmniOS will be
cryptographically signed. In order to be able to install these new
packages there are two r151006 package updates that must be applied
before attempting an upgrade:

The ca-bundle package delivers the OmniTI CA certificate that pkg(1)
will use to verify the signing certificate for r151008 packages, and the
updated pkg knows where to find this CA certificate.

If you already have these package updates, the above command will
indicate that no update is necessary.

Additionally there are a couple other packaging issues that can cause
dependency problems during the upgrade. Corrected packages for r151006
have been published, and must be applied to the global zone *and all
non-global zones* prior to upgrading to r151008.

 might be missing on your system. If so, the 151006 version of it should
be installed in your current BE and any non-global zones before
attempting an upgrade:

 is part of the default install and is always present. All users will
need this update:

 is an optional package and only needs to be updated if it is installed:

Note Current BE Name
--------------------

Make a note of the name of your current boot environment (BE) in case
you need to roll back. It may look something like this:

The current BE is the one marked 'NR' (active Now, active on Reboot.)

Perform the Upgrade
-------------------

If you have non-global native (ipkg) zones, they must be shutdown and
detached at this time. Once the global zone is updated and rebooted, the
zones will be upgraded as they are re-attached to the system. This is
not necessary for s10-branded zones or KVM guests.

After shutting down the zones gracefully (zlogin; shutdown -i5 -g0 -y):

It would also be a good idea to take a ZFS snapshot of the zone root in
case it's needed for rollback (such as if there are issues with the zone
upgrade.) where <zoneroot> is the name of the ZFS dataset whose
mountpoint corresponds to the value of *zonepath* in the zone's
configuration. There are child datasets under this one, so we use the
option to recursively snapshot all.

Update the global zone. The argument is optional, but it's nice to use a
name that's more meaningful than “omnios-N”. Add a '-nv' after the
'update' sub-command to do a dry run if you're unsure of what will
happen.

This will create a new BE and install r151008 packages into it. When it
is complete, reboot your system. The new BE will now be the default
option in GRUB. If your hardware supports it, you may get into the new
BE via [fast reboot](http://illumos.org/man/1M/reboot), in which case
you won't see a GRUB menu.

Once booted into your new r151008 BE, if you don't have non-global
zones, you're done.

If you have non-global native (ipkg) zones, attach each one with the
option, which will upgrade the zone's core packages to match the global
zone.

Assuming the attach succeeds, the zone may be booted as usual:

Rolling Back
------------

### ZFS Upgrade

OmniOS r151008 includes new zpool feature flags. Post-upgrade you will
see a message like this in **zpool status**:

**If you want to be able to roll back to your previous environment, DO
NOT upgrade your zpools yet.** The upgrade is one-way and irreversible.

If, for some reason, you need to roll back to r151006, simply activate
the previous BE and reboot. where <be-name> is the name of the previous
BE that you noted at the beginning.

If you have native zones but had not yet attempted to attach them, they
remain unchanged from the previous BE and may be re-attached once booted
into the previous BE. Simply omit the from the attach example above.
Note that even if you tried to attach but the attachment failed
completely (perhaps due to a packaging issue), then the zone data
remains unchanged and you can still safely re-attach it in the previous
BE.

If you are rolling back because there was a problem with the zone attach
in which the zone was partially updated, then you will need to roll back
each of the zone root datasets that you snapshotted after detachment.
There is no recursive rollback, so we have to roll back each of the
datasets one at a time.
