OmniOS r151004
==============

## r151004y

Weekly release for 15-19 Apr 2013

* Security fixes
  * `web/curl` - 7.30.0, [libcurl cookie domain tailmatch](http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20130412.html),
    [libcurl SASL buffer overflow vulnerability](http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20130206.html)

  * `incorporation/jeos/omnios-userland` - relaxes restrictions on curl and
    gnu-coreutils packages to allow for the above updates

## r151004v

Weekly release for 1-5 Apr 2013

* Updated packages
  * `network/dns/bind` - 9.9.2-P2, [Removed the check for regex.h in configure](https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-00889) (isc.org).  OmniOS does not ship libregex so there is no security vulnerability.
  * `system/pciutils/pci.ids` - updated to 2013-03-29 snapshot

## r151004t

Weekly release for 18-22 Mar 2013

* Security fix
  * `driver/virtualization/kvm` - fix for CVE-2013-1798
    [Fix bounds checking in ioapic indirect register reads](http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2013/q1/702).

*Note:* The illumos KVM implementation is **not** vulnerable to the
other two CVEs that are related to this one (1796, 1797)

If you do not run any KVM guests, you likely do not have the kvm driver
loaded. Simply updating the package will be sufficient. An updated
omnios-userland incorporation package is required as well, which relaxes
the version constraint on the KVM packages. A blanket 'pkg update' will
take care of this, but if you are not applying all available updates,
you need, at a minimum: `omnios-userland`, `driver/virtualization/kvm` and `system/kvm`

To update the kvm driver on a running system:

* Obtain the module ID, which is the first column in the output of modinfo(1M):
  ```
  # modinfo | grep kvm
  266 fffffffff8325000  39ff0 265   1  kvm (kvm driver v0.1)
  ```
* Shut down all KVM guests.
* Unload the current module using the ID obtained above:
  ```
  # modunload -i 266
  ```
* Load the updated module:
  ```
  # modload -p drv/kvm
  ```
* Verify the updated module has loaded.  Note the change in size from the previous info (third column):
  ```
  # modinfo | grep kvm
  266 fffffffff8325000  39eb0 265   1  kvm (kvm driver v0.1)
  ```

If you encounter errors with the above procedure, just reboot.

## r151004r

Weekly release for 4-8 Mar 2013

* Security fixes
  * `security/sudo` - fixes for
    [Authentication bypass when clock is reset (CVE-2013-1775)](http://www.sudo.ws/sudo/alerts/epoch_ticket.html) and
    [Potential bypass of tty_tickets constraints CVE-2013-1776)](http://www.sudo.ws/sudo/alerts/tty_tickets.html)
    * Requires updated omnios-userland to relax the version restriction
* Updated packages
  * `system/pciutils/pci.ids` updated to 2013-03-02 snapshot

As always, a `pkg update -nv` will do a “dry run” and show you the
proposed upgrades.

## r151004n

Weekly release for 4-8 Feb 2013

* Security fixes
  * `library/security/openssl@1.0.1.4` - SSL, TLS and DTLS Plaintext
    Recovery Attack (CVE-2013-0169)
    [OpenSSL advisory](http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20130205.txt)
    * Shortly after r151004n was announced, we were made aware of a
      [regression](http://rt.openssl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=2975)
      in 1.0.1d that causes corruption of the data stream on x86_64.
      We have applied the patch referenced in the ticket and re-published
      the package
    * The omnios-userland incorporation was overly restrictive with the
      openssl version. In order to update openssl, do:
      ```
      # pkg update omnios-userland openssl
      ```
    * This [shell script](Attachments/ssl_services_to_restart.sh)
      will examine running processes in the current zone and tell you which services
      need to be restarted to complete the update
* Updated packages
  * `system/pciutils/pci.ids` updated to 2013-02-05 snapshot

## r151004j

Weekly release for 7-11 Jan 2013

* Updated packages
  * `system/library/pcap` - backported fix from bloody which corrects a build issue that results in a missing symbol.
  * `system/pciutils/pci.ids` - updated to 2013-01-07 snapshot

## r151004h

Weekly release for 24-28 Dec 2012

* Updated packages
  * `developer/versioning/git` - Now with man pages! Git documentation is written in
    [AsciiDoc](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/), which requires an enormous number
    of dependencies, adding support overhead and bloat for little benefit. Git's man
    pages are now [built on a different system](BuildInstructions.md#git) and included
    in the final package.

## r151004f

Weekly release for 10-14 Dec 2012

* New packages
  * `system/management/ec2-api-tools` - API tools serve as the client interface to
    the Amazon EC2 web service
* Updated packages
  * `network/dns/bind` - BIND 9.9.2-P1 client utilities
  * `system/pciutils/pci.ids` updated to 2012-12-08 snapshot

## r151004b

Weekly release for 12-16 Nov 2012

* Bug fixes
  * Missing build dependency for `system/management/ipmitool` resulted in bmc
    interface not working. Recompiled with correct support
* New packages
  * `system/management/ec2-credential` - Service that handles Amazon EC2 ssh key
    setup at boot time. Already included in official AMIs; not relevant outside AWS
* Updated packages
  * `system/pciutils/pci.ids` updated to 2012-11-11 snapshot
