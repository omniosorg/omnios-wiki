Upgrade instructions: [Upgrade_r151006_r151008](Upgrade_r151006_r151008.md)

* Highlights
  * All packages shipped as part of OmniOS r151008 are now cryptographically signed
    * All package signatures will be verified by default, including on systems upgraded from r151006
    * More strict policies regarding signatures are possible. See “signature-policy” under
      IMAGE PROPERTIES in the pkg(1) man page for details
  * New ZFS pool features: spacemap_histogram, multi_vdev_crash_dump, extensible_dataset
    * see zpool-features(5) for details on what these features do
  * Rewritten ZFS write throttle to produce more consistent delays under constant load
    * This supersedes the per-zone I/O throttle feature taken from illumos-joyent
      in r151006. We are investigating a compatible feature set
  * ZFS L2ARC compression
  * Dump volumes may now be placed on multi-vdev pools such as raidz, striped mirrors
  * Oracle Java SE 6 replaced with OpenJDK 7
  * GCC 4.8.1
