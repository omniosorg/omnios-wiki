Stable Release, April 14, 2016

`uname -a` shows omnios-r151018-ae3141d

Last full illumos-gate merge was [62dadd6](https://github.com/illumos/illumos-gate/commit/62dadd6).

[r151018 release repository](http://pkg.omniti.com/omnios/r151018/)

Please read the [upgrade instructions](Upgrade_to_r151014.md)
carefully. They were written for r151014, but they apply to r151018 as
well.

### What's new in this release?

The `debug.illumos` variant is now available on the r151018 repository. This allows DEBUG kernel modules to be installed that match the non-DEBUG kernel modules' functionality.  The default value for `debug.illumos` is `false`.  To change it:

A clone of non-DEBUG exists and has been updated and activated.
On the next boot the Boot Environment DEBUG will be
mounted on '/'.  Reboot when ready to switch to this updated BE.

(0)# beadm list

```


Like a `pkg update` with new kernel modules, changing the DEBUG/non-DEBUG variant
creates a new boot environment and requires a reboot.

This is helpful for systems that are encountering problems that require
full kernel debugging. Before this, a user would have to either build
the DEBUG illumos-omnios bits and onu(1M) them, or just be limited to
whatever `/etc/system` tuning was available.

Thanks to Jeff “jeffpc” Sipek for his contribution to this.

**NOTE**: A DEBUG kernel will be noticeably slower.

**NOTE2**: Updating a BE updates with whatever `debug.illumos` variant is set,
and does not update the other `debug.illumos` BE.

* The illumos `uname -v` output now will contain the branch
  from which illumos-omnios was built (for easier identification):
  ```
  r151018(~)[0]% uname -v
  omnios-r151018-ae3141d
  r151018(~)[0]%
  ```
* Many SMB/CIFS improvements from upstream illumos: SPNEGO authentication,
  DC locator updates, and SMB2 support
* Timezone info now at 2016c
* A fresh ISO/USB installation provides a de-UTF-8ed version of
  `/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/tab/country.tab`, so the Caiman installer
  does not break. Post-installation and post-network-configuration,
  a `pkg fix zoneinfo` will revert this tab to its proper UTF-8 setting.
  Upgraded releases or Kayak installs are not affected
* On new ISO, USB, or Kayak installations, OpenSSH is installed instead of SunSSH
* OpenSSH 7.2p2 contains more of the SunSSH feature set. Also, because upstream
  SunSSH changed (the addition of ssh-common), the methods to switch between SunSSH
  and OpenSSH have slightly changed as well. To switch from SunSSH to OpenSSH
  (remove --no-backup-be if you wish to generate backup Boot Environments):
  ```
  # /usr/bin/pkg install --no-backup-be --reject pkg:/network/ssh --reject pkg:/network/ssh/ssh-key --reject pkg:/service/network/ssh --reject pkg:/service/network/ssh-common pkg:/network/openssh pkg:/network/openssh-server
  ```
  To switch from OpenSSH to SunSSH:
  ```
  # /usr/bin/pkg install --no-backup-be --reject pkg:/network/openssh --reject pkg:/network/openssh-server pkg:/network/ssh pkg:/network/ssh/ssh-key pkg:/service/network/ssh pkg:/service/network/ssh-common
  ```
* For improved portability from Linux: a full flock() implementation
* “Last login” hostnames can now be longer (including IPv6 addresses)
* Various small & medium-sized ZFS bugfixes and enhancements
* Synced mDNS with upstream
* LBA48 support in GRUB (Installers do not support installing this yet, however)
* Support for the Intel I219 Gigabit Ethernet chipset
* cpqary3 support for more HP Gen9 smart array controllers
* vmxnet3s virtual network adapter support.  Works especially well on ESXi guests
* Various other small & medium-sized bugfixes
